I'm working on Codecademy's Web Developer curriculum. This is a project challenge after completing a beginning level of html and css. I felt comfortable posting it as they did not provide step by step guidance. Codecademy provided a description, the jpegs, a spec sheet, and a sample to try and copy. I haven't seen Codecademy provide this style of project before (I did a lot of their Python material in the last few months). With the single task to complete (come back when, you're done), I really appreciate the autonomy provided by this challenge. Maybe later I'll make it more dynamic with some javascript, or prettier with more advanced css and frameworks.
